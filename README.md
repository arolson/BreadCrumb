# BreadCrumb
Bread Crumb is a simple car locator application that aims to keep the user's experience as straightfoward as possable. 
This application was built as a capstone project for the Udacity IOS Developer course.

# User Interaction
The user may place a pin (that is designed to look like a loaf of bread) on their current location or anywhere on the map they choose.
By pressing on a pin a user may choose to navigate back to the pin, take notes, take a snapshot, or look for places of interest within a 500 meter radius using the GooglePlaces web service API.
The navigation is completed by the Apple Maps app.
Each pin (along with it's notes and snapshot) is stored persistently using CoreData.
